                    When I look into your eyes
                    <br>
                    I can see a love restrained
                    <br>
                    But darlin' when I hold you
                    <br>
                    Don't you know I feel the same
                    <br>
                    Nothin' lasts forever
                    <br>

                    And we both know hearts can change
                    <br>
                    And it's hard to hold a candle
                    <br>
                    In the cold November rain
                    <br>
                    We've been through this such a long long time
                    <br>
                    Just tryin' to kill the pain, oo yeah
                    <br>
                    But love is always coming and love is always going
                    <br>
                    And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today
                    <br>
                    Walking away
                    <br>
                    If we could take the time
                    <br>
                    To lay it on the line
                    <br>
                    I could rest my head
                    <br>
                    Just knowin' that you were mine
                    <br>
                    All mine
                    <br>
                    So if you want to love me
                    <br>
                    Then darlin' don't refrain
                    <br>

                    In the cold November rain
                    <br>
                    Do you need some time on your own
                    <br>
                    Do you need some time all alone
                    <br>
                    Everybody needs some time
                    <br>
                    On their own
                    <br>
                    Don't you know you need some…

                    <br>


                    Don't hang your head in sorrow
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Somethin' is changin' inside you
                    <br>

                    <br>

                    Don't you cry tonight

                    <br>
                    And don't you cry tonight
                    <br>

                    Give me a whisper
                    <br>
                    And give me a sigh
                    <br>
                    Give me a kiss before you
                    <br>
                    Tell me goodbye
                    <br>
                    Don't you take it so hard now
                    <br>
                    And please don't take it so bad
                    <br>
                    I'll still be thinkin' of you
                    <br>
                    And the times we had... baby
                    <br>

                    And don't you cry tonight
                    <br>
                    Don't you cry tonight

                    And don't you cry tonight
                    <br>

                    And please remember that I never lied
                    <br>
                    And please remember
                    <br>
                    How I felt inside now honey
                    <br>
                    You gotta make it your own way
                    <br>
                    But you'll be alright now sugar
                    <br>
                    You'll feel better tomorrow
                    <br>
                    Come the morning light now baby
                    <br>

                    And don't you cry tonight
                    <br>
                    And don't you cry tonight

                    Just an urchin livin' under the street
                    <br>
                    I'm a hard case that's tough to beat
                    <br>
                    I'm your charity case
                    <br>
                    So buy me somethin' to eat

                    Ya gotta-keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
                    <br>
                    You know it's, it's all a gamble
                    <br>
                    When it's just a game
                    <br>
                    You treat it like a capital crime
                    <br>
                    Everybody's doin' their time
                    <br>

                    The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe
                    <br>
                    I'd have another cigarette, but I can't see
                    <br>
                    Tell me who you're gonna believe
                    <br>

                    Oh, won't you please take me home
                    <br>

                    So far away
                    <br>

                    Turn me around and take me back to the start
                    <br>
                    I must be losin' my mind—"Are you blind?"
                    <br>
                    I've seen it all a million times
